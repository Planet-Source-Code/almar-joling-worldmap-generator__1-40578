### Description

This program will create like almost infinite worldmaps, at any dimension you wish. It will also return a planet (spherical map) if you wish. Note that the code is pretty fast

This code is a port from an CGI version, the URL is included in the zip for the interested people.

Note: I left all the variable names like they were in the CGI version, ditto for the comments, so the code isn't exactly in the right way.
